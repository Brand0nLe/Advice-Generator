The project involves calling an API (https://api.adviceslip.com/) to retrieve random advice quotes and displaying them to the user in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.

## Code Details

The main component of the application is `AdviceGenerator`, which is a functional component. It uses React hooks, specifically `useState`, to manage the advice data state. When the dice button is clicked, it makes a fetch request to the Advice Slip JSON API to retrieve a random advice message. The fetched data is then stored in the component state, and the advice is displayed in the interface.

## Project Details

The Advice Generator project aims to test the ability to recreate a product with the same styles based on provided images. It utilizes React and Bootstrap to build a functional and visually appealing interface for generating random advice messages. The random advice messages are obtained by calling the Advice Slip JSON API. The project serves as an exercise in front-end development and showcases the ability to replicate a given design.
